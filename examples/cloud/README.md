### Quickstart

### Quickstart

**First run (initial setup):**
```bash
cd blux-lite
chmod +x first_start.sh
./first_start.sh
```
This script will:
- set permissions
- install/verify dependencies
- prepare config folders
- **generate `auto-start.sh`**

**After first run (normal use):**
```bash
./auto-start.sh
```
This launches `blux-lite.sh` (Legacy/TUI menu).

# Cloud Helpers (Optional)

These are **examples** only and are **disabled by default** in public releases.

To enable:
1. Copy any needed script from here into your local environment.
2. Create a `.env` at repo root (based on `.env.example`).
3. Export `BLG_ENABLE_CLOUD=1` before running.
4. Never commit secrets.
